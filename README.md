# Night&Day

## Description
This is the test level for my Comprehensive Creative Technologies Project.      
This demo will take you through alternate versuons of a level all using different techniques to make the environment unsettling.

## How to Access
To access the Unity project, open the repository folder from Unity Hub. It should take a while to download and launch as it uses a lot of assets.   
To access the Executable build of the level, unpack the WorkingBuild.rar file then run  NightAndDay.exe in the WorkingBuild folder.

## Recommendations
It is recommended that you run the test level on a Computer with at oeast 8GB of RAM and a dedicated GPU.   
It is recommended that you play through the level with a controller although it will work with a mouse and keyboard.

## How to play

Use WASD to move and the mouse to look around. Press F to navigate through scenes or interact with the level.  

## Controller controls  
Use the left stick to move and the right stick to look around. Press The West gamepad button to navigate through scenes or interact with the level.
